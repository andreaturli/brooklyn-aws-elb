Brooklyn support for ELB
------------------------

Gives support for AWS's Elastic Load Balancer.

Note: this will likely be rolled into core https://github.com/brooklyncentral/brooklyn.
However, it currently depends on the 10MB aws-sdk so this dependency has deliberately not 
been added to core brooklyn.
